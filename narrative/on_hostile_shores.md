# On Hostile Shores

## Overview

The play flow in linear fashion through approximately seven short
scenes: 

1. The yacht (the first attack)
1. The reef
1. The beach
1. The ruins
1. The eye (at the ruins)
1. The tunnel

The BBEG will attack the yacht, and will return at the ruins (or
wherever works best). 

## Background

> It’s 1930 in French Polynesia. You (the Frogiers), a wealthy French
> family, are returning to Tahiti after holidaying on the atoll of
> Rangiroa. They are travelling on a 82- foot wooden yacht called the
> Blue Coast, which has no sail and relies on a diesel engine for its
> propulsion. It has cabins and a luxurious art deco lounge, along
> with other spaces like a wine cellar, engine room, cockpit, cabins
> for the crew and a galley.

> Shortly after leaving port, the yacht encounters a fierce storm and
> is blown off course. Battered by wind and waves, the engine stops
> working and the captain and another crew member are swept from the
> deck. The tender is also swallowed up by the raging sea.

> After a week adrift, you spy an island on the horizon towards which
> you are drifting with the current.


## On The Yacht

> Under a leaden, sunless sky, as the drizzle
> starts to fall, the island looms into view, buried in a wild
> jungle and with a mountain rising from its centre. The
> Blue Coast is carried towards some reefs near the sandy shoreline.

> Suddenly a knocking can be heard against the boat’s hull, before
> something rams into its stern propelling the vessel towards the
> rocks. It all happens in an instant: there’s no time to wait.

* With a **Pilot (Boat)** roll the force of the impact can be reduced
  and the boat can be run aground without suffering excessive damage.
* The others can try to save themselves. 
* If the strategy is a good one, the collision will cause no damage.
* If the yacht suffers the full force of the impact, then the rocks
  split open the hull and the Blue Coast begins to sink, ending up
  half-submerged in the water.
* Anyone who hasn’t made it to safety or isn’t secured to the vessel
  suffers 1D6 damage.

> Moments after the impact, a huge articulated arm cov- ered in fine
> hairs and resembling that of a crustacean, emerges from the
> water. It writhes about in the air, a pincer at its end opening and
> snapping shut and clearly looking for something.

* All invcestigators to roll **Sanity** (0/1D6)
* Players can state their actions.
* If there are investigators on deck, the pincer hurls itself at
  whoever has the greatest Size, with a hit chance of 40%.
  * If they can’t dodge the attack, the victim is held 
    and suffers 1D3 crushing damage. 
  * On the next round, the monster can carry them back into the water,
    where the character begins to drown and continues to suffer damage
    on each round.
  * They can break free with an Extreme success on a **Strength** roll
    or if someone wounds the arm, in which case it recoils and returns
    to the water.
* If the investigators are searching for something specific in the
  boat, from a weapon to a can of diesel, the Keeper can use their
  common sense to decide in which part of the boat it can be found.
  * If they see fit, they can ask for **Luck** or **Spot Hidden** rolls.


## The Reefs

> The Yacht is now stranded on the rocks, with a deadly creature
> prowling in the water. The drizzle turns to rain and claps of
> thunder can be heard in the distance. The beach is roughly 150
> metres away.


* Swimming to shore requires a **Swim** roll and prevents characters from
  carrying any items in their hands. 
  * If an investigator fails the roll, they lose a valuable item or
    1D4 Hit Points from exhaustion or being battered by the rocks.  
* In any case, once on the beach they are safe from Tikarei for the
  time being.

* They can also cross the rocks to get to the shore. This is
  especially complicated and requires a Hard success on a **Jump**
  roll.
  * If they fail, the investigator is wounded and suffers 1D6 damage,
    as well as losing anything carried in their hands.  
* In any case, the rocks eventually come to an end and sharpened
  wooden stakes appear in their place, clearly the remains of an
  artificial construction.  From here, they can swim to the beach
  without making a roll as the water is only waist deep.

* Fumbling or failing a pushed roll means Tikarei emerges from the water (SAN 1/1D10) and
  pounces on the unfortunate character. 
* The investigators have one round to react. 
  * If they run deeper into the bay, the creature is unable to attack
    for the moment, although it launches itself at the rocks in an
    effort to get past them.
  * At this point, if theinvestigators are watching they see the
    monster’s entire body:
	
> Tikarei has the appearance of a gigantic orange crab, the front of
> which consists of a great human torso with a bald head and no
> eyes. Its only recognisable feature is a mouth lined with teeth. One
> of its arms is human, albeit oversized, and the other is a massive
> articulated and extendable pincer, which can stretch out to over 30
> feet in length.

## The Beach

> The beach lies in a bay of white sand, with dense jun-
> gle vegetation growing at its edge. 50-foot-high walls
> of rock at its top end cut the beach off from the rest of
> the island. 

* In theory these cliffs could be climbed, but under the rain and
  without the right equipment this requires a Hard success on a
  **Climb** roll.
  * If the investigator fails they fall 1D10+5 metres.
  
> On the beach itself, where the sand meets the vege-
> tation, a carved stone Polynesian tiki stands roughly
> three feet in height. It is of a man with a fish head and
> huge, gaping mouth. 

* If the tiki is examined more closely, an unusually crafted, basalt
  knife can be found in the mouth, not of Polynesian origin. 
  * Besides its ritual use, if the weapon is brandished at Tikarei, the creature
  hesitates and takes no action for one round.  
  
> Stone ruins can be found among the trees and bushes, at the foot of
> the cliff: the remains of columns and masonry.

* When they reach this place the investigators come upon a cleared
  area. Someone is obviously keeping the vegetation at bay here,
  which would explain why the construction has not been devoured by
  the jungle.
* The style of the architecture is not Polynesian.  With an
  **Archaeology** roll, it can be linked to the city of Nan Madol, in
  Micronesia, thousands of miles away.
* The **Occult** skill reveals it is associated with the mythical
  Naacal civilisation, which once inhabited the continent of Mu,
  according to pseudoscientific theory.


## The Ruins

### The Door

> The construction’s stone, filigree-covered door stands 10 feet tall
> and is adorned with glyphs produced by an unknown culture . There is
> no keyhole or door knob and there appears to be no way of opening
> it.

* **Occult** reveals it was made by the Naacal. 
* The door can only be activated when a fluid is poured into the fish
  mouth (see “[The Eye](#eye)”).
  * Then a clicking sound can be heard and it slowly opens by itself,
    as if by some eldritch power.
	
### The Reliefs

> There is a masonry stone wall covered in (Naacal-style)
> murals. These show people dressed in ceremonial attire pouring a
> liquid over a naked man in a pit (Handout 1).  The adjacent reliefs
> reveal the same scene, only the man in the pit has been replaced
> with a tentacular being with arms and legs, (*which bears a striking
> resemblance to the monster that attacked them on the reefs, assuming
> they saw all of it*) (Handout 2). Next to this, a procession of
> warriors and priests surrounds what, judging by the scale, must be
> an enormous figure with multiple mouths and eyes. The priests appear
> to be using recipients to collect a liquid that is pouring from
> the being. At the centre of this creature there is a vertical
> opening measuring some two inches in length (Handout 3).

* The basalt knife fits perfectly in the opening and, when placed
  there, activates a spring of black fluid in the Eye (see “[The
  Eye](#eye)”).
  * When the blade is removed, the fluid stops flowing. 
  * Any similar object measuring over 6 inches long can produce the
    same effect, such as a conventional knife or piece of wood cut to
    measure. A small branch would fit in the opening, but would break
    before the mechanism is activated. 
  * The investigators must use their ingenuity or make something that
    serves the same purpose as the knife.
  * This might require skill in **Mechanical Repair**, **Survival** 
    or **Art and Craft**.
	
### The Eye <a name="eye"></a>

> Another wall stands just at the foot of the cliff, formed by a
> single, immense block of basalt embedded in the rock. An eye the
> size of a watermelon has been en- graved in the basalt, the pupil of
> which is an orifice that penetrates deep into the stone, giving off
> an indescribable organic smell. Lined up along the foot of the
> wall are five small sculptures standing around a foot high. They all
> represent creatures with a deranged expression looking upwards with
> their mouths open.  Their jaws reveal orifices that lead to some
> kind of pipe. The sculptures are of a bird, a fish, a turtle, a bat
> and a lizard.

* When the knife is placed in the aforementioned opening (see “The
  Reliefs”), a viscous black liquid begins to pour from the eye. 
  * The liquid trickles down the wall without falling on any of the
    sculptures, eventually disappearing down a drain in the floor.
* To activate the door, some of this ooze must be poured into the
  figure of the fish, a choice that can be deduced from the tiki on
  the beach or by smelling the sculptures; the fish is the only one
  that gives off a smell similar to that of the pupil in the eye.
  * An **Int** roll may help
* The investigators must find a way to guide the stream of black fluid
  to its destination.
  * The easiest way to do this is by using a branch or ribbed
    leaf. 
  * Focus here on whether or not any of the characters touches
    the liquid.  
  * If they explicitly try to avoid doing so and you believe their
    strategy requires skill, ask for a **Dexterity** roll. If they
    fail to protect themselves or are unable to successfully complete
    their task, describe how drops fall onto the investigator’s skin.
  * The liquid stings and stains their skin with greenish
    streaks. This is significant for the adventure’s conclusion.  
* If black fluid enters the wrong mouth, a jet of liquid suddenly
  springs from the eye spattering all those present.

## Tikarei's Return

* Ideally, while the investigators are examining the ruins, the
  prospect of being trapped between the cliff and the sea monster will
  rack up the tension. Tikarei will be arriving at the beach before
  too long hungry for victims, so a confrontation is inevitable sooner
  or later.  If the investigators fail a roll and, as a result, you
  decide their task takes too long, or you feel they are wasting a
  significant amount of time, Tikarei emerges from the sea and comes
  up onto the beach. It lets out a bloodcurdling howl and begins to
  scuttle towards them using its hands and feet. The second time they
  fail a roll or waste time, the monster reaches the ruins or wherever
  the investigators are at that moment.
* In the event they have taken some course of action to distract or
  hold up the creature, they may gain a little extra time, assuming
  you think their idea effective.  A decoy made from their own
  clothing, for example, would serve the purpose.
* When Tikarei sees the investigators, it will automatically pick out
  any that are wounded, thanks to the powerful allure of the smell of
  fresh blood. With a **Climb** roll, characters could shin up a tree
  or scale an overhang of rock to safety. If the creature cannot reach
  its prey, it gives up and goes for the next closest character. Since
  it is guided by smell, there is little use in trying to
  hide. However, body odour can be disguised using diesel oil, for
  example, or by making blood decoys to distract it.

## Conclusion

* Once opened, the investigators step through the door to see a tunnel
  on the other side made from large blocks of cut stone. Near the
  entrance there is a lever on the wall. If activated, the door can be
  opened and closed.  
* The passageway ends in a cavern with a
  subterranean river flowing through it. Moored to a small wooden
  jetty is a boat similar to those used by Tahitian fishermen.  
* If any of the investigators have been stained by the black fluid,
  they must now make a **Luck** roll. If successful, they feel sick
  and notice in horror how the green streaks have spread across their
  skin. They need help walking, but that’s as serious as it gets - in
  this adventure at least.
* If they fail the roll, they fall victim to a strange psychosis: they
  begin to empathise with the monster they are being hunted by and see
  the island as their home.  They also view their companions as
  strange beings that must be annihilated. The character’s player
  should be informed of their new objectives, which they must try to
  accomplish to the best of their abilities. In such a scenario,
  remember that being attacked or betrayed by a fellow investigator
  requires a 0/1D4 or 1D6 Sanity roll, depending on the closeness of
  the relationship.
* They must take the boat to get away from the island, untying it from
  the jetty and floating away on the current. They drift through a
  cave and soon reach the sea through a narrow strip of water between
  rocks and two rows of sharpened stakes. A **Pilot (Boat)** roll is
  required to make it to the open sea without incident.  Failing this
  means everyone must make a **Strength** roll.  The character with the
  lowest score topples out of the boat and disappears beneath the
  waves.
* Presently, the storm abates and rays of sunshine begin to filter
  through the clouds. The adventure can end here, with the surviving
  investigators leaving the island behind them, on their way to a more
  heartening horizon.
